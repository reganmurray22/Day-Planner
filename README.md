Homework Week 5 Third-Party APIs

## Criteria:

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The app should display standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot should represent one hour and contain the following:

The hour

A field to hold user input

A save button

## Description
Near the top of the calendar, the application displays the current day, the body displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.  Additionally, each hour should be color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past (grey), the present (red), or the future (green), which will change depending on the time of day. 

## Credits
The Moment.js library was used to work with date and time.
